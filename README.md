# Cross Lingual Embeddings

This project looks into a set of approaches to building cross-lingual embeddings.

Our data comes from pre-trained word vectors for 157 languages from fastText. We have included samples for the French and English word vector files in the [data section](./data).

We also got a dictionary of data separated into 3 parts for train, dev and test. We obtained the dictionary from Facebook research's MUSE project.

We reviewed 3 papers in our literature review and evaluated 4 models. More information can be found in the write-up [here](./project_writeup.pdf). Slides that provide a brief overview of our extensions are also available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IbZiGizBVxXD841FMwtqKCxyi83rCOg7yyhaqP1wGvg/edit#slide=id.p).
